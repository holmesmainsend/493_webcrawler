# 493_webcrawler team project

## Note: crawler in its current form is inoperative on account of new updates to the urllib.robotparser library. However, if all the code related to this reading of the robots.txt is commented out then the crawler will still successfully return data in a CSV as intended.

## Team members are Spencer Smalley, Spencer Nauss, Matthew Capece, Sean Holmes, and Nicole Rodriguez

## Final version of crawler is uploaded as PythonCrawler.py

## Sample results from the CSV are also included in this repository
